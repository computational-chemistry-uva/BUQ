GROMACS reminds you: "In science it often happens that scientists say, 'You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,' and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion." (Carl Sagan)

It was better then, probably, in terms of proportions, not necessarily in women being paid as much as men and so forth, but definitely, there were women around." (Barbara Liskov)

Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -s md.tpr -plumed Colvars/plumed_2.513_2.513.dat -nsteps 100000 -x Colvars/traj_2.513_2.513.xtc


Back Off! I just backed up md.log to ./#md.log.1#
Compiled SIMD: AVX_512, but for this host/run AVX2_256 might be better (see
log).
Reading file md.tpr, VERSION 2022.5-plumed_2.9.3 (single precision)
Note: file tpx version 127, software tpx version 129
GPU-aware MPI detected, but by default GROMACS will not make use the direct GPU communication capabilities of MPI. For improved performance try enabling the feature by setting the GMX_ENABLE_DIRECT_GPU_COMM environment variable.

Overriding nsteps with value passed on the command line: 100000 steps, 200 ps

comm-mode angular will give incorrect results when the comm group partially crosses a periodic boundary
Using 1 MPI process

Non-default thread affinity set, disabling internal thread affinity

Using 4 OpenMP threads 


Back Off! I just backed up traj.trr to ./#traj.trr.1#

Back Off! I just backed up ener.edr to ./#ener.edr.1#
starting mdrun 'Generated by trjconv : Generated by trjconv : Alanine in vacuum in water t= 4500.00000'
100000 steps,    200.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up confout.gro to ./#confout.gro.1#

NOTE: 13 % of the run time was spent in domain decomposition,
      3 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)

GROMACS reminds you: "Still I had a lurking question. Would it not be better if one could really 'see' whether molecules as complicated as the sterols, or strychnine were just as experiment suggested?" (Dorothy Hodgkin)
